function ret = mpfr_sinh_cosh (sop, cop, op, rnd)
% Set simultaneously SOP to the hyperbolic sine of OP and COP to the
% hyperbolic cosine of OP, rounded in the direction RND with the
% corresponding precision of SOP and COP, which must be different
% variables.  Return 0 iff both results are exact (see ‘mpfr_sin_cos’
% for a more detailed description of the return value).
